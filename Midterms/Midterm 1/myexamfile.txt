
Lofi Girl

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Lofi Girl, formerly ChilledCow, is a YouTube channel and music label established in 2017. It streams lo-fi hip hop music 24/7, accompanied by a Japanese-style animation of a girl studying or relaxing.


History [edit]
The YouTube channel "ChilledCow" was created by Dimitri on 18 March 2015.
ChilledCow began streaming lo-fi hip hop music meant for people to listen while studying on 25 February 2017.
The live stream was taken down by YouTube between July and August 2017 for using footage of a girl studying from the animated film Whisper of the Heart (1995).
The livestream was later reinstated with a custom animation of a girl studying.

The music used in ChilledCow's live streams were either released through the ChilledCow label or were given permission to use by another artist.
YouTube briefly removed the channel without explanation but reinstated it after a public backlash.
The original live stream that was stopped by the take down was 13,000 hours long, making it one of the longest videos on YouTube.

On 18 March 2021, six years after the creation of the channel, it was announced that the channel would rebrand from ChilledCow to Lofi Girl.
The YouTube community posts explained how Lofi Girl had become the icon of the channel, and that it would fit as the new channel name.


Character [edit]
The Lofi Girl, studying in winter.
Lofi Girl streams are accompanied by an animation of a girl studying or relaxing who has come to be known as the Lofi Girl, the Lofi Study Girl, or the "24/7 lofi hip hop beats" girl.
The channel began using the Lofi Girl for its streams in March 2018.

Dimitri originally used the character Shizuku Tsukishima from the Studio Ghibli film Whisper of the Heart (1995) as the face of the channel, with footage of her studying or writing used in the streams.
When the popularity of the streams ultimately led to channel being taken down for copyright violations, Dimitri decided to maintain the Ghibli-esque aesthetic but with an original character and put out a call for artists.

One of the artists who responded was Juan Pablo Machado (also known as Santo Puppy).
Originally from Colombia, Machado moved to Lyon in 2013 to study at the Ã‰mile-Cohl design school, after a stint at the art school of Bogota.
In September 2018, during his last year of his Master's degree, he decided to respond to a call for tenders received by his school.
The tender from ChilledCow called for a "student busy revising for her classes, with Miyazaki-esque visuals."
Machado, who was not previously familiar with lo-fi aesthetic, decided to send in his sketches.
Several positions were tested for the Lofi Girl, including a lying position, at the end of which she would return to her initial position; this did not carry over into the final product because it took too long to animate.
The background was originally plain black in order to save animation time, but Machado eventually decided to place La Croix-Rousse in the window instead.
